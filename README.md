# MASTERMIND

  A guessing game that puts you, the "Codebreaker", in the hotseat trying to guess what 4-color combination the computer, the "Codemaker", has chosen.

## Learning Goals

  - Learning how to make a terminal game with no visual elements until the game is actually functional.
  - Diving deeper into Scope and making classes interact.
  - Develop skills in collaborative development.

## Project Overview

  In this project we created a game that followed the style of the classic [MASTERMIND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) codebreaking game. The codebreaker tries to guess the codemakers pattern, in both order and color, with hints given for incorrect guesses.

  The game keeps track of how many guesses you've taken and also prevents the codebreaker from providing answers that are too short or too long.

  While the user can use the hints to determine the eventual winning choice, they can also input the character 'c' to be given the actual Codemakers code.

  When the user finally inputs the hidden code, they are presented with a message informing them of their win and how many turns it took them to get there. It also gives them the opportunity to play again, or quit the game.
